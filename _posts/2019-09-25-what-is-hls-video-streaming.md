## The need for HLS video streaming

I've written about [ABR or adaptive bitrate video streaming]({% post_url 2019-09-22-what-is-abr-or-adaptive-bitrate-streaming %}) in the past and discussed in detail what ABR is used for. To recap, adaptive bitrate video delivery is a way of delivering video where the player or client detects the available bandwidth and then modulates/adjusts the quality of the video stream between multiple bitrates and/or resolutions (typically referred to as a "bitrate ladder")

## Why is OTT so popular? I DONT KNOW

OTT's popularity in my opinion comes down to one thing - convenience of being able to access your media (songs, movies, shows, podcasts, etc.) - **anytime, anywhere, and on any device**.

With traditional cable television, you had to be in front of your television at a particular time and place to be able to catch your favorite show.

However, with OTT, you could be at the mall, or in a bus, or sitting at the dentist's clinic and as long as you had a stable internet connection, you could watch your show on any device and at anytime.

It is this freedom that caught the interest of the public and has lead to the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, DAZN, YouTube becoming insanely popular.

It has also caused a spurt in industries surrounding the OTT space like companies to encode, stream (packaging, CDNs, multi-CDN routing, federation), player companies, analytics, AI, recommendation engines, and the list goes on.

The OTT revolution has also lead to several mergers in the industry and has lead to content producers launching their own services (like Disney+). Most traditional linear TV channels are also being forced to rethink their strategies and launch OTT channels (however, I am not sure that these are making money yet!)

## So, will OTT replace linear TV?

OTT is extremely popular and surveys clearly indicate that millennials associate with OTT services as "TV" rather than traditional television (linear). But, OTT comes with its own set of problems - like the cost of internet and the lack of high-speed broadband "everywhere", technical issues like start-up delays (a.k.a latency or join-time), buffering, and a fractured subscription landscape where every provider is trying to lower their prices and gather as many subscribers as possible.

**There is a long way to go, but, make no mistakes about it - OTT is here to stay and rule! If you aren't on the bandwagon already, it's time you purchase a ticket, hop on, and enjoy the OTT ride ;)**
