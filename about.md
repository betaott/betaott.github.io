The OTT Video Streaming industry is growing in leaps and bounds every single day with innovations and products being launched at a breath-taking speed. Take a look around and you can see innovations in 4K, 8K, VR, AR, Ad Insertion, Monitoring, Recommendations, Codecs (AV1, VVC), Packaging, and so much more. 

I have spent close to 11 years in this industry in different roles - right from a researcher to an engineer to a product and project manager. This has given me an unique perspective into what happens in the industry and I'd like to share that with you. 

Let me know what you think in the comments section and I'll be sure to get back to you. 

PS: I am not fond of publicity, hence the anonymity. 

Take care and keep visting!
