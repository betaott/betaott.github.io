The OTT Video Streaming industry is growing in leaps and bounds every single day with innovations and products being launched at a breath-taking speed. Take a look around and you can see innovations in 4K, 8K, VR, AR, Ad Insertion, Monitoring, Recommendations, Codecs (AV1, VVC), Packaging, Players, Streaming services, and so much more. It's a fantastic industry to be in, but, its a pretty steep learning curve with niches that can take years to understand fully. And, the best part is that, by the time you thikn you've understood something fully, the industry has moved on to something different! Oh boy! 

## A little about me ##
I have spent close to 12 years in this industry in different roles - I've done fundamental research on certain topics that form the backbone of the OTT industry, done my fair share of coding when I was an engineer, done customer support, pre & post-sales, and spent years in product and project management.

This has given me an unique perspective into what happens in the industry and I'd like to share that with you. My goal is to write about the technological under-pinnings (both fundamental and state-of-the-art), current and upcoming trends, and share industry news on this site (betaott.com). And, I think that the world lives in beta - hence the name of this site. 

## Contact Me ##
If you want to contact me for anything technical, research, analysis, etc., please use my email ID: **ottbeta [at] gmail [dot] com** and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Take care and keep visting! 

PS: I am not fond of publicity, hence the anonymity. Perhaps, we've already met at a mixer or a convention ;)
