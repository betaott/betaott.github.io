<p>I‚Äôve written about <a href="https://google.com">ABR or adaptive bitrate video streaming</a> in the past and discussed in detail what ABR is used for. To recap, adaptive bitrate video delivery is a way of delivering video where the player or client detects the available bandwidth and then modulates/adjusts the quality of the video stream between multiple bitrates and/or resolutions (typically referred to as a ‚Äúbitrate ladder‚Äù)</p>

<h2 id="why-is-ott-so-popular-i-dont-know">Why is OTT so popular? I DONT KNOW</h2>

<p>OTT‚Äôs popularity in my opinion comes down to one thing - convenience of being able to access your media (songs, movies, shows, podcasts, etc.) - <strong>anytime, anywhere, and on any device</strong>.</p>

<p>With traditional cable television, you had to be in front of your television at a particular time and place to be able to catch your favorite show.</p>

<p>However, with OTT, you could be at the mall, or in a bus, or sitting at the dentist‚Äôs clinic and as long as you had a stable internet connection, you could watch your show on any device and at anytime.</p>

<p>It is this freedom that caught the interest of the public and has lead to the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, DAZN, YouTube becoming insanely popular.</p>

<p>It has also caused a spurt in industries surrounding the OTT space like companies to encode, stream (packaging, CDNs, multi-CDN routing, federation), player companies, analytics, AI, recommendation engines, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>The OTT revolution has also lead to several mergers in the industry and has lead to content producers launching their own services (like Disney+). Most traditional linear TV channels are also being forced to rethink their strategies and launch OTT channels (however, I am not sure that these are making money yet!)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="so-will-ott-replace-linear-tv">So, will OTT replace linear TV?</h2>

<p>OTT is extremely popular and surveys clearly indicate that millennials associate with OTT services as ‚ÄúTV‚Äù rather than traditional television (linear). But, OTT comes with its own set of problems - like the cost of internet and the lack of high-speed broadband ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù, technical issues like start-up delays (a.k.a latency or join-time), buffering, and a fractured subscription landscape where every provider is trying to lower their prices and gather as many subscribers as possible.</p>

<p><strong>There is a long way to go, but, make no mistakes about it - OTT is here to stay and rule! If you aren‚Äôt on the bandwagon already, it‚Äôs time you purchase a ticket, hop on, and enjoy the OTT ride ;)</strong></p>
